### What is Atom HK?
Atom HK is a standalone Habbo retro housekeeping, aiming to provide you and your staff with a solid tool, that can help with managing various aspects of your hotel. Atom HK offers an easy development experience thanks to the use of Laravel & Bootstrap.

*Standalone means it is its own project / application, rather than being implemented directly into the CMS. This allows you to use Atom HK with any CMS / emulator you'd want, all it requires is for you to tweak it a little to match your database structure.*

### CMS / Emulator Support
Atom HK supports [Atom CMS](https://github.com/ObjectRetros/atomcms) out of the box, but since it's a standalone application, you can use it for any CMS or emulator you'd want. All that is required from you is to modify it a bit, so it matches your database structure.

### Why was Atom HK made?
I always felt that the retro community was lacking a solid housekeeping base, which could essentially be used with any emulator or CMS, with just a little tweaking. Which has lead me to the creation of Atom HK.

Atom HK is using **industry approved** technologies to give developers the smoothest experience possible, no need to learn a self-made framework with no documentation which is not only hard to understand but also to maintain.

### What technologies does Atom HK use?
Atom HK is built around solid and battle tested technologies, to provide the best user & developer experience possible. 

Here's a list of the core technologies Atom HK is built around.
- PHP (Laravel 9.x) [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x)
- Vite [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Bootstrap [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/).

**Why Laravel?**<br />
The goal of Atom HK is not to show the world how "good" we are as a developers by creating an entire system from scratch that normally lack proper documentation & is hard to customize or maintain, it's to provide a solid system to fellow developers / users, that want to either open their want to be able to manage their hotel properly or simply contribute towards Atom HK, Taken this into consideration we most certainly believe Laravel is the best choice available to achieve such.

Laravel has been developed for over a decade, it's powering thousands of large scale applications around the web. Its documentation is looked at as one of the best available, it also has a **huge** community around it alongside with tons of **free** learning resource available to learn the framework, which is another big reason behind the choice of using Laravel for Atom HK.

Due to the "simplicity" of Laravel and it's learning resource available, you don't need to be a PHP expert to work with Atom HK - All it requires is that you're willing to put a little effort into learning the basics, once you've done that, it'll be smooth sailing from then.

Here's a few **free** learning resources available, which I highly recommend you to have a look at if you want to get into Laravel.

- [https://bootcamp.laravel.com/](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/)
- https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch
- https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9

The Laravel bootcamp is the official bootcamp provided by the Laravel team, while Laracasts is an official learning platform for Laravel, so do not worry if you take the time to watch the courses, you'll be taught some of the best practises by some of the best teachers.

Enough of the introduction. It's time to have fun and get into the setup process of Atom HK üçª
