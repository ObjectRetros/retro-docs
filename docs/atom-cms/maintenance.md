# Enable maintenance
Sometimes you might want to enable maintenance on your hotel, to prevent users from entering certain period due to having to do some work on your hotel.

As most other stuff in Atom enabling maintenance is super easy! Head into your ``website_settings`` table and set ``maintenance_enabled`` to ``1``.

Depending on the maintenance work needed, you might wish to allow all or some of your staff members to enter your hotel during the maintenance period and if that's the case you can set the ``min_maintenance_login_rank`` to the minimum rank you want to allow access to the hotel during the maintenance ðŸ”§

You can also set a custom maintenance message inside of the ``website_setting`` table, just look for ``maintenance_message`` and enter the message you want to show to everyone visiting your hotel during a maintenance period ðŸ”¨
