### What is Atom CMS?
Atom CMS is a Habbo retro CMS, aiming to provide an easy and solid experience for you and your users. It offers an easy development experience and it even comes with its own theming system, making it a breeze to create your own [themes](https://github.com/qirolab/laravel-themer).

### Why was Atom CMS made?
Atom CMS was made to bring the retro community a modern and robust CMS, using **industry approved** technologies which is not only easy to understand but also "easy" to work with. Another reason to why Atom CMS was made was also to bring a variation to the CMS options available to the retro community. With Atoms built in theme system, it becomes a breeze to brew up a new layout in no time, leaving room to either customize your hotel further, or simply contribute to the community by bringing new and exciting themes.

### What technologies does Atom CMS use?
Atom CMS is built around solid and battle tested technologies, to provide the best user & developer experience possible. 

Here's a list of the core technologies Atom CMS is built around.
- PHP (Laravel 9.x)
  [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x).
- Vite [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/).


*Depending on the theme used*
- TailwindCSS [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) & Official Tailwind intro [video course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elgqxmdVms8&list=PL5f_mz_zU5eXWYDXHUDOLBE0scnuJofO0).
- Bootstrap [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/).
- Vanilla CMS or something else

**Why Laravel?**<br />
The goal of Atom is not to show the world how "good" we are as a developers by creating an entire system from scratch that normally lack proper documentation & is hard to customize or maintain, it's to provide a solid system to fellow developers / users, that want to either open their own retro or simply contribute towards Atom CMS and to achieve that we most certainly believe Laravel is the best choice available.

Laravel has been developed for over a decade, it's powering thousands of large scale applications around the web. Its documentation is looked at as one of the best available, it also has a **huge** community around it alongside with tons of **free** learning resource available to learn the framework, which is another big reason behind the choice of using Laravel for Atom CMS.

Due to the "simplicity" of Laravel and it's learning resource available, you don't need to be a PHP expert to work with Atom CMS - All it requires is that you're willing to put a little effort into learning the basics, once you've done that, it'll be smooth sailing from then.

Here's a few **free** learning resources available, which I highly recommend you to have a look at if you want to get into Laravel.

- [https://bootcamp.laravel.com/](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/)
- https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch
- https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9

The Laravel bootcamp is the official bootcamp provided by the Laravel team, while Laracasts is an official learning platform for Laravel, so do not worry if you take the time to watch the courses, you'll be taught some of the best practises by some of the best teachers.

That's introduction of Atom CMS! It's now time have fun and get into the setup process of Atom CMS üçª
