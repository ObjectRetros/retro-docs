# Setup

On this page, we'll go through all the initial steps on how to get Atom CMS up & running!

### Requirements
The following requirements is necessary to set up Atom CMS:
- PHP 8.1 or above [PHP Downloads](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)
- MySQL 8.x or MariaDB 10.x
- Composer v2 [Composer Download](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- NPM (LTS) [Node Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- An Arcturus Morningstar database [Database repository](https://git.krews.org/morningstar/arcturus-morningstar-base-database)

Once all of the above has been installed & setup, you can continue doing the following:
Open CMD (Command Prompt) and navigate into the path you want the CMS to be located at, and run the following commands:

### Coming from another cms?
If you're coming from another CMS like Cosmic CMS and is unsure what tables to remove or worry about colliding tables names, then fear no more!

Even tho we **highly recommend** to do a proper cleanup yourself, Atom CMS has a built-in option to rename colliding table names and drop matching foreign keys.

All you have to do is to change `RENAME_COLLIDING_TABLES=false` to `RENAME_COLLIDING_TABLES=true` within your `.env` file (You'll get to the .env file in the next step). Once the feature is enabled, Atom CMS will **attempt** to solve any conflicts that might happen due to the use of another CMS.

#### Required extensions
Please verify the following extensions are enabled inside your `php.ini` file. If they have a `;` in front of them it means that they're commented out and not enabled. Simply remove the `;` to enable them.
```ini title="php.ini"
extension=curl
extension=fileinfo
extension=gd
extension=mbstring
extension=openssl
extension=pdo_mysql
extension=sockets
```

### Windows Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/ObjectRetros/atomcms.git
cd atomcms
copy .env.example .env (Don't forget to edit the database credentials inside the .env)
composer install 
npm install && npm run build:atom (For development run: npm run dev:[theme-name] (eg. npm run dev:atom))
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --seed

* You must link your site to the public folder of Atom CMS
```

#### Required permissions
Please make sure the atomcms folder is granted "Full control" for both the IUSR & the IIS_IUSRS.

Here's a GIF of me doing it on a different folder: [https://gyazo.com/7d5f38525a762c1b26bbd7552ca93478](https://gyazo.com/7d5f38525a762c1b26bbd7552ca93478) the principle is the same, you just do it on the "atomhk" folder.

#### Using HTTPS
In case you're using HTTPs through Cloudflares "Always redirect to HTTPs" feature, you should set `FORCE_HTTPS=` within your `.env` file to `true` this it to make sure everything is properly using HTTPs. This is necessary for some features in Atom CMS to work properly when you're letting cloudflare handle the HTTPs redirects without a dedicated SSL certificate.

#### cURL error
If you're receiving a cURL 60 error due to for example. Setting up findretros, then make sure you download the latest `cacert.pem` from [https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html). Once downloaded place it within a folder of your choice. For example within your ``C:/`` folder.<br/><br/> 
Once you have placed your download certificate within a folder, you must open your ``php.ini`` file, and search for ``curl.cainfo``, once you have found the following, you have to uncomment it (Remove the `;` in front of it) and put the absolute path + your certificate name.<br/>

**Here's an example**
```ini title="php.ini"
curl.cainfo="C:/cacert-2022-07-19.pem"
```
Save the file and your problem should now be solved.

### Linux Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/ObjectRetros/atomcms.git
cd atomcms
cp .env.example .env (Don't forget to edit the database credentials inside the .env)
composer install
npm install && npm run build:atom (For development run: npm run dev:[theme-name] (eg. npm run dev:atom))
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --seed
```

**Grant necessary permissions to the following folders. Within your "atomcms" directory, enter the 4 commands below:**
```console title="Paste the following in your terminal"
sudo chown -R $USER:www-data storage
sudo chown -R $USER:www-data bootstrap/cache
chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache
```

For NGINX, you can copy the config from here: [Deploy a site on nginx](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/deployment#nginx)

**If you are using Atom CMS in production, don't forget to change the following variables:**
```dotenv title="Within your .env change the following"
APP_ENV=local to APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=true to APP_DEBUG=false
```

### Disable rocket loader
Atom CMS uses Javascript in certain areas, which unfortunately conflicts with Cloudflares Rocket Loader feature. So in-case you have Rocket Loader enabled on Cloudflare, you will have to disable it, otherwise you **will** run into various annoying issues when using Atom CMS.

To disable or check if Rocket Loader is enabled on Cloudflare, all you have to do is, head to your Cloudflare dashboard and find "Speed" -> "Optimization" in the navigation menu, once you've clicked on the "Optimization" menu point, scroll about halfway down until you find "Rocket Loaderâ„¢" and then un-toggle it in-case it's enabled. That's it! Rocket loader is now disabled, and you're all good to go.
