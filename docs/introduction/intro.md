# What is this site?

This site is made for the community to enjoy. A place where you can find guides on how to set up Atom CMS & Atom HK and even an in-depth guide taking you from A-Z on how to setup your entire own retro.

Our goal for the future is to provide much more content, than we already do, may it be on how to add new furniture to your hotel, adding new clothing, creating clothing, creating furniture etc - But as anything else, things take time and we don't have any ETA on when new guides will be added.
